## :dart: About ##

Oh, It is that time of the week again ... I'm doing weird things based of the ideas by CodingSloth ([I can still recommend his Newsletter btw.](https://slothbytes.beehiiv.com/subscribe?ref=leLwLkdsZI)).
And yeah this time I think I really got bored, because guess what I wrote an entire operating system, only to do the coding exercise.
So this is this project just try and enjoy it and if you need anything just tell me.

## :sparkles: Features ##

> Be warned this is still in early development so it may not work as well as you'd (or I'd) hope it would.

**If you want more info or help just hit me up with the ways listed in the Starting section or on my website ([jotrorox.com](https://jotrorox.com/))**

## :white_check_mark: Development Requirements ##

Before starting :checkered_flag:, you need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com), [GCC Cross-Compiler](https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler) and [nasm](https://nasm.us/) installed. (Atleast that should be it)

<br>

I also really can recomment you using [qemu](https://www.qemu.org/) to develop and run this.

## :checkered_flag: Starting (Development Setup) ##

```bash
# Clone this project
$ git clone https://github.com/Jotrorox/vowelOS

# Go into that directory
$ cd vowelOS

# Build the Project
$ ./build.sh

# Run the Project
$ ./build.sh run
```

**If you encounter Problems just hit me up, I'm happy to help you get started**\
**You can do that over matrix: @jotrorox:matrix.org or Discord: https://discord.gg/RVr4cceFUt**

## :dash: Getting Started ##

So you really wanna use this for god knows what?\
Here you go I guess ...

```bash
# Build an ISO
$ ./build.sh iso
```

Then just run it of a usb or in virtualbox
